Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Management Science at Sauder School of Business,  University of British Columbia. My advisor is Prof. [Michael Jong Kim](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/michael-jong-kim). As a researcher,
I aim to utilize statistical learning and stochastic control methods to address challenges inherent in data-driven decision-making, especially within healthcare and revenue management applications. My recent research has focused on improving decision-making in complex information-sharing environments. (e.g., misinformation, strategic behaviors). Details can be found [here](https://xyz2023ca.github.io/publications/).



Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my Master of Applied Science degree in Operations Research from the University of Toronto and my Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and Mathematics from McGill University.
You can find my CV [here](https://xyz2023ca.github.io/assets/pdf/Xinyuan%20Zhang%20CV.pdf).


**I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.**






<!---My main research interests are in Bayesian learning and stochastic control. In particular,  I am interested in the interplay of strategic incentives and optimal leanring  with applications in revenue management and healthcare.

 Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
