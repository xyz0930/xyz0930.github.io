I am particularly interested in improving decision-making within complex information-sharing environments and system dynamics. My recent research topics include:

-	Spread and control of misinformation in online platforms
-	Optimal combination of forecasts from multiple biased sources
-	Service allocation with customer returns

  
In terms of methodologies, my research inquiries are addressed using a broad spectrum of tools, including dynamic programming,  Bayesian statistics, applied probability, reinforcement learning, decentralized control,  and robust optimization.
