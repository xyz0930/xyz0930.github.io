I am particularly interested in improving decision-making within complex information-sharing environments (e.g., misinformation, biases, strategic behaviors) and optimizing service operations in stochastic systems with complex dynamics (e.g., random returns and reassessments). My recent research topics include:

-	Spread and control of misinformation in online platforms
-	Optimal combination of forecasts from multiple biased sources
-	Service allocation with customer returns

  
In terms of methodologies, my research inquiries are addressed using a broad spectrum of tools, including dynamic programming,  Bayesian statistics, applied probability, decentralized control, learning in games and robust optimization.
