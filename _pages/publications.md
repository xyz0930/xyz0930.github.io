description: My research focuses on improving data-driven decisions with application particularly in healthcare (e.g., ICU operations, pathology scheduling) and revenue management (e.g., advertising on E-commerce plat-forms, demand forecasting).

My recent research topics include:
-	Spread and control misinformation in E-commerce networks 
-	 Optimal combination of forecasts from multiple biased sources
-	Service allocation with customer returning to the systems

  
In terms of methodologies, I combine statistical learning with stochastic control. Specifically, my research inquiries are addressed using a broad spectrum of tools, including dynamic programming, robust optimization, Bayesian statistics, data-driven optimization, decentralized control, and social learning models. In the long term, I aim to apply these tools to generate insights into decision-making in complex information-sharing and stochastic environments and provide practical guidelines to improve efficiency in the associated operational settings.
