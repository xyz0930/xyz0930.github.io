I taught Operations & Logistics (COMM 204) at Sauder School of Business, UBC, during the 2021-2022 academic year. It is an introductory course in operations management (OM) for students in the BCom program, covering basic topics ranging from process analysis and queuing systems to inventory and supply chain management. I incorporated frontier OM research, especially advances in data-driven decision making, into the course design. 
I received 4.6 out of 5 for my teaching evaluation, reflecting positive feedback from a class of 58 students.

I also had the opportunity to deliver guest lectures on advanced applied probability and stochastic modelling  for the Stochastic Processes (MIE 1605H) course, which is a part of the Master of Financial Engineering program at University of Toronto.
