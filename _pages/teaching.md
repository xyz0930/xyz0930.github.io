**Instructor**

I taught Operations & Logistics (COMM 204) at Sauder School of Business, UBC, during the 2021-2022 academic year. It is an introductory course in operations management (OM) for students in the BCom program, covering basic topics ranging from process analysis and queuing systems to inventory and supply chain management. I incorporated frontier OM research, especially advances in data-driven decision making, into the course design. 
I received 4.6 out of 5 for my teaching evaluation, reflecting positive feedback from a class of 58 students.
